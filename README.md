# Quiz Game
This repository contains a simple quiz game that fetches questions from an external API and presents them to the user. The game is built using Node.js with Express.js, EJS for templating, and jQuery for frontend interactivity.

# About
This is my first-ever API project, and while I didn’t fully commit to polishing it, I’m using this as a practice opportunity to learn and improve my skills. There are a lot of bugs and rough edges, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made so far. Feel free to explore the project and share any feedback!

# Features
- Fetches trivia questions dynamically from Open Trivia Database.
- Interactive user interface with question navigation and scoring.
- Fully responsive design styled with CSS.

# Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
